**The Emerging Relational Economy: Exploring Alternatives to "There Is No Alternative" (TINA)**

This repository hosts a simple, interactive website designed to explore diverse economic models, challenging the long-held notion that "There Is No Alternative" (TINA) to neoliberal economic solutions.

**About the Project**
This website is an interactive component stemming from "The Prosperity Study," a foresight project that posits a "Relational Economy" is emerging from the current "Transactional Economy" (often termed 'Late Stage Capitalism'). This emergent relational economy manifests in various forms and under many names worldwide, demonstrating a rich landscape of robust, well-developed alternative economic models.
The core idea is to illustrate that what comes next is not a single replacement for the current system, but a broad umbrella encompassing many diverse, alternative economic systemsâ€”proving that alternatives are plentiful, and it's time to say goodbye to TINA.

**Key Features**
**Contextual Overview:** Introduces the "Transactional," "Transition," and "Relational" economic pathways, drawing insights from the original Prosperity Study.
Emergence Signals: Highlights key indicators of a shifting economic paradigm, signaling the move towards a post-capitalist future.

**Interactive Comparison Framework:** Allows users to select specific "Comparison Aspects" (e.g., Worldview, Values, Economic Mechanisms) and see how various alternative economic models approach these aspects. 

This includes:
Traditional Indigenous Economies (Indigenomics)
Post-Labour EconomicsAbundance Economics
Wellbeing EconomicsCircular Economics
Participatory Economics
Social Solidarity Economy (SSE)
Degrowth EconomicsEcological Economics
Regenerative Economics

**AI-Powered Insights:** Features an integration with the Gemini API, allowing users to generate a concise "sparkle summary" of any selected economic model, providing quick, AI-powered overviews of their core principles.

**Blue Oceans of Opportunity:** Explores four key "Blue Oceans" for wealth creation within the emerging Relational Economy, as identified by the study.

**Embedded Chatbot:** Includes a direct embed of Jenn McRae's AI chatbot for further interactive Q&A and exploration of these concepts.
